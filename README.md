Full stack graduate project made using **Spring Boot** and **Angular**. The application features simplified remakes of the Google's services for contacts and photos, as well as the login/registration process. Project's main goal is to, in its respectable separate halves, display a complete process of creating a full-stack application. However, Google's services were used as loose guidelines for both the UI design, and the functionalities.
